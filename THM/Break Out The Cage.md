Checking the folders we can see:

- /images/ contains images used for the index page
- /html/ is empty
- /scripts/ contains some random dialogs
- /contracts/ has a “FolderNotInUse” file
- /autitions/ has a supposedly corrupted audition file

Checking the file we hear Nicholas Cage talking and a weird noise. After checking the noise in a spectrogram we can see some text:

Hey Son

Buddy, Sean left a note on his desk with some really strange writing on it. I quickly wrote
down what it said. Could you look into it please? I think it could be something to do with his
account on here. I want to know what he's hiding from me... I might need a new agent. Pretty
sure he's out to get me. The note said:

haiinspsyanileph

The guy also seems obsessed with my face lately. He came him wearing a mask of my face...
was rather odd. Imagine wearing his ugly face.... I wouldnt be able to FACE that!! 
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahah get it Weston! FACE THAT!!!! hahahahahahahhaha
ahahahhahaha. Ahhh Face it... he's just odd. 

Regards

The Legend - Cage
