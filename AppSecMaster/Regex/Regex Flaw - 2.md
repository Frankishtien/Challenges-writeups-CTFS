```python
 if request.method == 'POST':
        url = request.form.get('url')
        pattern = r'^https:\/\/.*appsecmaster\.net$'

        if url and re.match(pattern, url):
            hostname = urlparse(url).hostname
            
            if hostname == 'evil.com':
                message = "URL Hit Successfully"
                with open('/tmp/masterkey.txt', 'r') as f:
                    masterkey = f.read()
            else:
                message = "URL Hit Successfully"

        else:
            message = "Invalid URL. Must contain a whitelisted domain." 
```


```python
pattern = r'^https:\/\/.*appsecmaster\.net$'
```

### so regex is **`^https:\/\/.*appsecmaster\.net$`**


- **`^https:\/\/`** : it must start with`https://`
- **`.`** It means any character (except a newline).
- **`*`** It means zero or more letters.
- This means that any text is allowed here after ``https://`` and before the word ``appsecmaster.net``
- **`appsecmaster\.net$`** : that is mean it must end with `appsecmaster.net`

#### let's try 


```
https://evil.com/.appsecmaster.net
```
