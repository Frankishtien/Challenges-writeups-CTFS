# level 30


> ### There is a git repository at ssh://bandit30-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit30-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit30-git is the same as for the user bandit30.

From your local machine (not the OverTheWire machine!), clone the repository and find the password for the next level. This needs git installed locally on your machine.






```
git clone ssh://bandit30-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:2220/home/bandit30-git/repo

### What is the tag in Git?

- It is a **tag** (like a “badge”) that you pin to a specific point in the commit log so that you can easily return to it later.

- You usually use it to specify a specific version of the project, such as a new version or an important point.
