When using ssh to get access to the machine, we are greeted with a slightly different shell: `WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL`. This already gives us an idea of what the shell does. Testing a simple command, we get the following:



```
>> ls
sh: 1: LS: not found

```


So everything we type seems to be made uppercase. The commands we have used so far however, are all lower-case and do not work. The one thing in Linux that is uppercase is variables. Specifically, the variable `$0` has a reference to a shell. You can see this with `echo $0` on your machine.
