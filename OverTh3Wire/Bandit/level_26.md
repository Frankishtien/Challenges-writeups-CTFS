❓ Why was the call closed immediately?

because:

Bandit26's shell is called showtext

This works:

```
more ~/text.txt
```

You have a large terminal

➡️ more View the whole file at once

➡️ Finish

➡️ The shell is locked

➡️ SSH connection lock

That's why I was in and out in two seconds 😄


✅ The correct solution (focus here 🔥)
------------------------

### 🔴 Before anything

**Make the terminal window very small**\
Make it small so that the text **does not cover the screen**
