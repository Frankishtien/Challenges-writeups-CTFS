# level 15


```
ssh bandit15@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

Almost the same idea as Level 14, **but the important difference** is that the connection must be **SSL/TLS encrypted**.

Meaning:

- `nc` ❌ It will not work

- You must use **openssl**


```
openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
```
